In the Global Playground, the virtual entities inhabit various behaviours, which are changed according to the environment they are in - their location.
Today's test was all about creating the change in the creatures' behaviour in certain areas.

In the following video you can see this test. The code was written in Processing. 
The virtual entities performed a flocking behaviour. Once they were located inside the black rectangle - they acquired a different 'behaviour' - a different pattern of movement .
