Behind the Concept:

Connectivity is everywhere.
Internet in general and Google in particular have made the world much more accessible. Distance has no meaning!
Social networks have also changed the way we meet new people and interact with the ones we know. We now spend much more time indoor than we ever used to.

Global Playground is all about resurrecting the familiar old sandbox playground - the one we have all used to play with in the outdoors, only this time it has new technology: The playground is no longer just a simple sandbox, but a combination of physical and virtual, real and imaginary environments. Users are no longer restricted by physical distance - they can be anywhere and take part in the game.
This all creates a borderless GLOBAL PLAYGROUND, that invites everyone to play and interact with local and distant users.

What do you think? Where is the "real" space of Global Playground?
