Global Playground is all about bringing the good old sandbox back to life! 
The first step is deciding what is the nature of the virtual beings (the 'creatures')? What kind of characteristics are they going to have? What kind of different environments are they going to live in? How are these virtual entities going to interact with the user (the observer)?
A scenario is needed here! 
Sand can be shaped in almost every possible way. In Global Playground – the user can create a very varied landscape - an imaginary world of hills and valleys, mountains and planes, snowy peaks, lakes and more.

The virtual entities will inhabit 'natural' behaviors that will change over time. Like every living creature – they will be able to eat and drink, move around, swim and crawl, breed and die. These beings will act differently in the various "environments" in the sandbox – some will eat only when they are in a vegetation area. Some will be able to breed only in water, etc.

How can real people interact with the sand box and with the virtual creatures? 
Well, local users (users who stand right next to the sandbox, in opposed to distant users who sit in their homes and interact with the installation via the Google applications) – will be able to change the terrains by moving and shaping  the sand. This changes the inhabitable spaces of the virtual "creatures". The users will affect their live-able spaces, and the beings will immediately respond to the changes in their terrain!
But how can the distant user affect the environment?
