So far I`ve been explaining about the interaction of the local user with Global Playground.  In this post I’m going to scribble my thoughts about the interaction of the distant users with it.
The interaction can be divided into two:
A.	View – The distant users would be able to watch the Global Playground whenever they want. That requires an open channel - 24/7, available online, showing the installation. This can be done by using YouTube channel – by YouTube Live Events or by using Three.js and chromeWebLab.

B.	Interact – Now, that`s the more tricky part. The interaction in Global Playground has two aspects: On the one hand, the distant users should be able to play in the playground. On the other hand, their play should affect the local users somehow, so it will be noticeable that there are more players than present in the room. Both the local and distant gamers should interact with the Global Playground and with one another!

The options:
a.	‘Screen interaction’ – the distant users will be able to influence the game of the local one by messing around with the virtual entities - add some food, install some virtual barriers on the playground etc. This will affect the way the virtual creatures move in the Global Playground space.
b.	‘Remote Control Interaction’ – the distant users will get the ability to shape the sand from distant. This can be achieved by a mechanical arm or a robot, which will be physically placed in the same location as the Global Playground. The robotic arm will shape the sand according to the remote user`s instructions. (Although I would also like to find a unique way for the distant users to play in the playground Rather than just replace their physical presence with a robotic one).
c.	‘Playground Visualisation’ – The ‘presence’ of the distant user has to be noticeable somehow. The global aspect of the playground should be visualized as well. People would probably like to know in which parts of the world Global Playground is being played at the same time they are interacting with it.

PLAYFULLNESS – So, why would distant players join the Global Playground?  If they can affect the physical space of the playground somehow and affect the virtual entities in a simple action - they will have an integrated part in the game! 
Also, as Global Playground is all about the interaction between Local and Global, I think that the distant gamer – the Global one - should be visible in some way within the space of the installation. For this reason, an image of the world’s map is going to be projected on the sand, and each player who joins the game will be shown on the sand (with the help of GoogleMaps, of course).  The ‘creatures’ are not only going to react to the terrain of the sand, but also to the projected borders, continents and oceans. Their living space will change according to the number of participants and their real location.


Here are few diagrams showing the idea of interaction:

3 Distant users are watching the installation - hence 'their countries' are 'turned on'

4	Users can now create different terrains in the lands areas as well.

5	This image demonstrates the virtual creatures appearence and interactivity on the projected map. The creatures will move and react דimultaneously and dynamically to the users interaction - so it will constantly change.
In the example here you can see that different creatures live in different environments. They also will change their behaviour (more details to come in next posts!)
