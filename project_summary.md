## Description
'Global Playground' is an interactive sandBox, where local and distant users can play and interact.

Imagine a sandbox with hills and valleys, mountains and lakes.

Virtual beings inhabit the different environments. Like in real life, each of them can only live in certain environments: some under the water, others on the hill top. 
Global Playground is a real sandBox on which different terrains are projected, following the sand shape. The virtual entities are projected on the sand as well. They react and interact with their environment and with each other. 

Local and Distant users will be able to watch the installation simultaneously by sharing a live video channel (ChromeWebLab).They will also be able to change and affect the environment. By doing so - they control the living populations in the sandbox.

Together, they all form the Global Playground - an environment that offers Symbiotic relationships between the physical and the virtual, the near and the far.
